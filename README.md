**Automation Test Store**


Automation Test Store simulates a real-world online store environment, offering typical e-commerce features like product browsing, cart management, user login, and checkout flow.

This project focuses on automation testing of the Automation Test Store (https://automationteststore.com/), a demo e-commerce website created specifically for 
educational purposes and software testing practice.

The goal is to develop automated test scripts that validate core functionalities of the site, improve testing efficiency, and demonstrate practical usage 
of automation tools and frameworks.
